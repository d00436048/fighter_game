# 🕹️ FIGHTER GAME

Fighter game is a 2d pixel brawler game inspired by street fighter. I originally made it
learn Pygame and better understand scene management, asset creation, sprite animation, graphics,
sound design, and overall python fundamentals. The game has a character and level selection screen as while as scene and state management systems
the gameplay is not finished.
